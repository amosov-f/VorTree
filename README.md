VoR-tree
=======

VoR-tree is Voronoi diagram with R-tree. In this project we present a new algorithm of Voronoi diagram (Delaunay 
triangulation) construction. This algorithm uses R-tree as assistant in construction, so, result is VoR-tree. 
Algorithm is asymptotically effective, simple and can be parallelized. Also, it is realized using MapReduce.
